# Music-Socialize


#Inspiration

According to what we searched there was not music application or there was no active music socializing application. So we wanted to come up with it. Something that can share other people's playlist and give feedback or leave comment.


#What it does

At this point it is quite simple. Once you login to the page we can access other people's playlists. Also we can get top-ranked tracks from the spotify API.

#How we built it

We used Spotify API, frontend Jinja2 and bootstrap, backend Flask, for database we implemented with MongoDB.


#Challenges we ran into

Using the Spotify API was more complicated than exepcted. Because it will return a chunk of data and accessing and formating with JSON was quite challenging. 


#Accomplishments that we are proud of

We learned how to use Spotify API and also we are proud that we came up with this idea because it is quite new. Also
we implemented main function in the limited time which is awsome!


#What we learned

We leanred how to use Flask because we have not used it before it is simple and easy to implement. Also we learned how to use Spotify API and how to handle data in datase as well.



#To improve

Since we want this web to serve a role for people to socialize such give feedback like how much they liked the shared playlist or leave comment on it, we plan to add chat or implement bulletin board so that people can talk.

#Built With

Python, Flask, MongoDB, Jinjs2 and Bootstrap
